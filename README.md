/*THIS IS A PROJECT CREATED FOR JAVA PRE-REQUISITE COURSE*/



It contains 20 Questions.There are 20 class files for all the questions. There is Main.java file in which I have created an object for all the 20 classes and comment it out. 
To run each question, just uncomment that particular object creation. 
You don't have to call any function explicitly since all the method implementation is done in constructors in each class.
Thank You:)
